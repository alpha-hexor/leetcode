# Title: capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days
## Question
<p>A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within <code>days</code> days.</p><br><br><p>The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> package on the conveyor belt has a weight of <code>weights[i]</code>. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by <code>weights</code>). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.</p><br><br><p>Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within <code>days</code> days.</p><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p><br><br><pre><br><strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5<br><strong>Output:</strong> 15<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:<br>1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5<br>2nd day: 6, 7<br>3rd day: 8<br>4th day: 9<br>5th day: 10<br><br>Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.<br></pre><br><br><p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p><br><br><pre><br><strong>Input:</strong> weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3<br><strong>Output:</strong> 6<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:<br>1st day: 3, 2<br>2nd day: 2, 4<br>3rd day: 1, 4<br></pre><br><br><p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p><br><br><pre><br><strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4<br><strong>Output:</strong> 3<br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>1st day: 1<br>2nd day: 2<br>3rd day: 3<br>4th day: 1, 1<br></pre><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p><br><br><ul><br>\t<li><code>1 &lt;= days &lt;= weights.length &lt;= 5 find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array find-peak-element koko-eating-bananas minimum-number-of-days-to-make-m-bouquets readme.md search-in-rotated-sorted-array search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii search-insert-position setup.sh single-element-in-a-sorted-array spiral-matrix spiral-matrix-ii test.py 10<sup>4</sup></code></li><br>\t<li><code>1 &lt;= weights[i] &lt;= 500</code></li><br></ul><br>
